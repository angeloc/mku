To use it, copy boot folder and rootfs folder to your embedded board. You can install them with:\r\n\r\n\t\tmku install_boot -d /media/boot\r\n\t\tmku install_rootfs -d /media/rootfs\r\n\r\n* If you want you can `pack` your boot and rootfs with:\r\n\r\n\t\tmku pack\r\n\tthey will be packed in `dist` folder in tar.gz format.\r\n\r\nDevelopment support\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nWith MKU you can also prepare a kernel development environment. MKU knows your board so it can download and set up a properly configured environment for your kernel development needs.\r\n\r\nYou can prepare your kernel development environment with:\r\n\r\n\tmku prepare_kernel\r\n\r\nYou can also prepare a scratchbox2 environment with:\r\n\r\n\tmku scratchboxit\r\n\r\nAcknowledgments\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nMany thanks to Robert Nelson (http://www.rcn-ee.com/) for keep running his wonderful infrastructure on which some parts of this software are based.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
